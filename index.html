    <h1>AURA PROXY Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 11, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the AURA PROXY mobile application (the "Service") provided by [Your Company Name/Developer Name]. We are deeply committed to protecting your privacy and security.</p>

    <h2>1. Core Functionality: VpnService Disclosure (Google Play Requirement)</h2>

    <p class="disclaimer">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> AURA PROXY utilizes the Android VpnService class for its core functionality—establishing a secure, device-level tunnel for user security and privacy. This is the only purpose for its use.
    </p>

    <p>In compliance with Google Play Developer Policy, we guarantee the following regarding our use of the VpnService:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The VpnService is **ONLY** used to create an encrypted tunnel from your device to our VPN server.</li>
        <li>We **DO NOT** use the VpnService to collect any personal or sensitive user data.</li>
        <li>We **DO NOT** redirect user traffic for malicious purposes, such as ad manipulation or serving hidden ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Our Commitment: The No-Logs Policy</h2>

    <p>AURA PROXY operates under a strict **No-Logs Policy**. We do not monitor, record, or store any information regarding your activity while connected to our VPN servers.</p>
    
    <p>We <strong>DO NOT</strong> collect or retain:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Browsing History** (Websites visited, content accessed).</li>
        <li>**Traffic Data** (Data volume, traffic destination, or DNS queries).</li>
        <li>**Connection Timestamps** (Specific times you connect or disconnect).</li>
        <li>**Source IP Addresses** (Your actual IP address).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your VPN usage remains private and secure.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Collection and Usage</h2>

    <p>We only collect the absolute minimum amount of data required to operate the Service, deliver free content, and maintain quality.</p>

    <h3>A. Data Collected (Non-Identifiable)</h3>
    <p>We collect the following non-personal data for the purposes described below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Device Identifiers (GAID):** Non-personal identifiers used by the advertising network.</li>
        <li>**App Performance Data:** Diagnostic logs, crash reports, and app version numbers.</li>
        <li>**Time Remaining Data:** The amount of time granted and consumed is stored **locally** on your device using Shared Preferences.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>B. How Data Is Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**App Functionality:** To initiate and terminate the VPN connection and manage the user's allocated connection time.</li>
        <li>**Advertising:** To serve and track rewarded video ads via Google AdMob (see Section 4).</li>
        <li>**Troubleshooting:** To diagnose and fix crashes and connection errors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Data Sharing (Advertising)</h2>

    <p>The Service is supported by **free, rewarded advertising**. To serve these ads, we integrate Google AdMob (a third-party SDK).</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Shared:</strong> Device Identifiers (GAID), device properties (screen size, OS version), and ad interaction data (did you click/watch the ad).</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is used by Google AdMob solely for the purpose of serving relevant advertisements and measuring their performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Security and Encryption</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Encryption in Transit:** All communication between the AURA PROXY app and our VPN servers is secured using industry-standard **AES-256 encryption**.</li>
        <li>**Server Security:** Our VPN server is configured to prevent the logging of all identifiable data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Rights and Data Deletion</h2>
    
    <p>You have the right to request access to and deletion of any data we hold that is tied to your usage (limited to non-personal identifiers as described above).</p>

    <p><strong>To Request Data Deletion:</strong> Please contact us via email at [YOUR SUPPORT EMAIL ADDRESS HERE] with the subject line "DATA DELETION REQUEST" and include your device ID (if known).</p>
